How to beat the competitors.
____________________________
           == Improve the search functionality:
              Review-aggreagation websites e.g Rotten Tomatoes' search functionality is not good. By that i mean;
                  + It is difficult to find movies by Title, Genre or director.
                    ( Improving the search functionality by making it more user-friendly and allowing users to search for movies by more criteria)

           == Add more features for users.
                  + Ability to create a watchlist.
                  + Track movies that they have seen.
                  + Share their thoughts on movies with other users.

           == Make the Website more mobile-friendly.
                  + Making the website easier to navigate with mobile phones.
                  + Making the text and images larger.

           == Add more content.
                  + Such as interviews with actors and directors.
                  + Behind the scenes footage.
                  + Trailers for upcoming movies.( Even links to youtube will be fine) But better if all is done on the site.

           == Improve the accuracy of the ratings.
                  + Try using a more rigorous methodology by using a different criteria.

        *********************************************************************************************************
          **suggestions for a more rigorous methodology for a review-aggregation about improving the ratings.
        *********************************************************************************************************

           == Use a wider range of critics. Since RottenTomatoes only uses Professional critics.(which we dont want) We should be able to involve everyone Including but not limited to:
                  + Professional Critics 
                  + Smaller Publications 
                  + Even those that specialize in different genres of film.
